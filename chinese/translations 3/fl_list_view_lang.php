//3. if there's a link in the middle of the text, the sentence is split in:
//	part 1: text before the link
//	part 2: text of the link
//	part 3: text after the link
//4. Never leave trailing spaces
//5. Keep sentences in one line only, even if very long.
//6. If a line starts with // that means it is a comment line. Leave it as it is.
